Hello, my name is James Nguyen and I'm currently a college freshman attending California State University Los Angeles majoring in Computer Science. I often like to spend my free time playing competitive shooters like Valorant and Apex Legends. Like every gamer, I'm always eager to hear about what's going on in the videogame community. IGN has been my number one source for news and updates about the gaming and entertainment industry. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't envious of how IGN employees get to directly interact with my favorite videogame titles from League of Legends to Halo. IGN's Code Foo program has given me the opportunity to take part in all the fun and learn new things. I believe that I carry the engineering skills and mindset that make me a worthy candidate that will benefit IGN and its community.
